# Financial-News-and-Stock-Price-Integration-Analysis-Week-1

Overview
    This project aims to analyze the relationship between financial news data and stock price movements. By combining sentiment analysis, technical analysis, and correlation analysis, the objective is to identify potential trends and trading signals that could inform investment strategies. The goal is to examine how sentiment, derived from news headlines, correlates with stock market performance for prominent companies.

The dataset used for this analysis includes financial news data and stock price data for the following companies:

AAPL (Apple Inc.)
AMZN (Amazon.com, Inc.)
GOOG (Alphabet Inc.)
MSFT (Microsoft Corporation)
META (Meta Platforms, Inc.)
TSLA (Tesla Inc.)

Methodology
1. Data Cleaning and Preparation:

Clean and preprocess the news data to remove noise, inconsistencies, and irrelevant information (e.g., non-financial headlines, missing values).
Load stock price data into a Pandas DataFrame for easy manipulation and analysis.
2. Sentiment Analysis:

Perform sentiment analysis on the news headlines using TextBlob. This tool calculates sentiment scores for each article, which represent the overall emotional tone of the headline (positive, negative, or neutral).
Calculate the sentiment polarity for each headline to assess whether it reflects positive or negative sentiment.
3. Technical Analysis:

Apply various technical indicators (e.g., RSI - Relative Strength Index, SMA - Simple Moving Average, EMA - Exponential Moving Average, MACD - Moving Average Convergence Divergence) to the stock price data.
Analyze trends, patterns, and potential trading signals that can inform buy/sell decisions based on historical stock price data.
4. Correlation Analysis:

Aggregate the sentiment scores by date, mapping each sentiment score to its corresponding date of publication.
Calculate the correlation between aggregated sentiment scores and daily stock returns to evaluate whether positive or negative sentiment correlates with price movement.
 Libraries and Tools
- Python:
    The primary programming language used for the analysis, providing flexibility and power for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.

- Pandas:
    Used for data manipulation and analysis, providing robust tools for working with time-series data, cleaning, and aggregating datasets.

- NLTK or TextBlob:
    Libraries used for Natural Language Processing (NLP) and sentiment analysis. TextBlob is used to calculate sentiment scores based on news headlines.
- TA-Lib:
    A library used for technical analysis calculations, including a wide range of indicators like RSI, SMA, EMA, and MACD.
- Matplotlib or Seaborn:
    Visualization libraries used to plot sentiment trends, stock prices, and technical indicators, enabling a clear view of the data and patterns
